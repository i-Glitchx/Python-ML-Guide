## Introduction

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions. This guide focuses on implementing machine learning algorithms using Python's extensive ecosystem of libraries, such as `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`, and `PyTorch`.

## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning involves using labeled data to train a model, allowing it to make accurate predictions. Topics include:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

Code Example:
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning identifies hidden patterns in data. Topics include:

- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

Code Example:
```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
kmeans.fit(X)
labels = kmeans.labels_
```

## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning trains an agent to make decisions through rewards and penalties. Applications include:

- Game playing
- Robotics
- Self-driving cars

## Deep Learning

Deep learning uses neural networks to model complex patterns in data. Frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch are commonly used for:

- Image recognition
- Natural language processing

Code Example:
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size=10, hidden_size=5, output_size=1):
        super(SimpleNN, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x
```

## Model Evaluation

Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, helping to ensure your model generalizes well to new data.

Code Example:
```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
```

## Python Libraries

Popular libraries for machine learning in Python include:

- **scikit-learn**
- **TensorFlow**
- **PyTorch**
- **pandas and NumPy**
- **matplotlib and seaborn**
