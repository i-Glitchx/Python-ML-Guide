            </header>
            <p>Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks. It is widely used in various fields including finance, healthcare, marketing, and technology to solve complex problems through predictive modeling and pattern recognition.</p>
            <p>Python is one of the most popular languages for ML due to its ease of use and the availability of numerous ML libraries such as <code>scikit-learn</code>, <code>TensorFlow</code>, <code>PyTorch</code>, and <code>Keras</code>. These libraries offer pre-built functions and tools to help implement a wide range of machine learning models and algorithms.</p>

            </header>
            <p>Supervised learning involves using labeled data to train a model, where the label represents the expected outcome. The goal is for the model to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs, so it can make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.</p>
            <p>Common supervised learning algorithms include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Linear Regression: Used for predicting continuous values, e.g., predicting house prices based on features like size and location.</li>
                <li>Decision Trees: A non-linear algorithm used for both classification and regression, which splits data into subsets based on feature values.</li>
                <li>Support Vector Machines (SVM): A powerful classification technique that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Example of Linear Regression in Python:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

            </header>
            <p>Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data, where the goal is to identify hidden patterns or relationships within the data. These algorithms are particularly useful for clustering or association tasks.</p>
            <p>Popular unsupervised learning algorithms include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>K-Means Clustering</b>: Partitions data into <code>k</code> clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.</li>
                <li><b>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</b>: A dimensionality reduction technique that helps reduce the number of features in the data while retaining important information.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Example of K-Means Clustering in Python:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
kmeans.fit(X)
labels = kmeans.labels_

            </header>
            <p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing certain actions in an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. Unlike supervised learning, RL does not require labeled input/output pairs; instead, the agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.</p>
            <p>Applications of RL include game playing (e.g., AlphaGo), robotics, and self-driving cars.</p>
            <p>Python frameworks like <code>OpenAI Gym</code> provide tools for developing and comparing RL algorithms in simulated environments.</p>

            </header>
            <p>Deep Learning is a subfield of ML that uses artificial neural networks with many layers (hence "deep"). These models are capable of learning complex features from large datasets and are used for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and more.</p>
            <p>Python frameworks such as <code>TensorFlow</code> and <code>PyTorch</code> are widely used for building deep learning models.</p>
            <p>Example of a simple feedforward neural network using PyTorch:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Defining a simple neural network
class SimpleNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size=10, hidden_size=5, output_size=1):
        super(SimpleNN, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

model = SimpleNN(input_size=10, hidden_size=5, output_size=1)
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
loss_function = nn.MSELoss()

            </header>
            <p>Evaluating a model's performance is crucial to ensure that it generalizes well to new data and does not overfit or underfit. Evaluation metrics vary depending on the type of problem being solved.</p>
            <p>Common evaluation metrics include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Accuracy</b>: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.</li>
                <li><b>Precision</b>: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.</li>
                <li><b>Recall</b>: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all the observations in the actual class.</li>
                <li><b>F1-score</b>: The weighted average of Precision and Recall, particularly useful when class distribution is imbalanced.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Example of calculating accuracy:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-python">
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
